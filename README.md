# IDisposable Leak Analyzer

A C# static analyzer designed to detect potential memory leaks related to incorrect or missing implementations of the `IDisposable` interface in .NET projects.

## üåü Overview

This tool scans your entire .NET solution, identifies classes implementing `IDisposable`, and detects possible memory leaks or resource disposal omissions. Results are clearly displayed in the console and recorded in a CSV file for easier analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Loads settings from an `app.config` file, where you can specify:
  - Solution path
  - Output directory
  - Language (English or Spanish)
  - CSV separator
  - Option to display MSBuild warnings/errors

- Utilizes the Roslyn API to parse the syntax and semantic model of your code.
- Reports instances where disposable objects:
  - Are created but never disposed.
  - Are returned by methods without proper disposal.
  - Are used in contexts lacking clear disposal patterns (`using`, `.Dispose()`, etc.).

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multi-language support:** English and Spanish.
- **Detailed logging:** Comprehensive results logged in an easily readable CSV file.
- **Console verbosity:** Optionally displays detailed MSBuild diagnostics.
- **Easy Configuration:** Adjustable via a straightforward `.config` file.

## üöß Limitations

- **Static Analysis Constraints:**
  - Cannot detect runtime-dependent disposal logic (e.g., conditional disposals).
  - May generate false positives if disposal occurs in methods outside of the analyzed scope (reflection, dynamic invocations).

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Large solutions may take considerable time to analyze.
  - High memory usage for very large codebases.

- **Configuration Dependency:**
  - Currently relies exclusively on a traditional `.config` file, not JSON-based configurations.

- **MSBuild Version Dependency:**
  - Specifically designed and tested to work with MSBuild from Visual Studio 2022. Using other MSBuild versions may produce unexpected results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework or .NET Core installed.
- MSBuild available on your machine (preferably from Visual Studio 2022).

### Configuration

Edit the `app.config` file to set up your project-specific parameters:

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="FullPathSolution" value="C:\Path\to\your\solution.sln" />
    <add key="CsvSeparator" value=";" />
    <add key="Language" value="EN" />
    <add key="ShowErrorsOrWarningsFromMsBuild" value="false" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

### Running the Analyzer

Simply execute the compiled program:

```shell
dotnet IDisposableLeakAnalyzer.dll
```

### Reviewing Results

Check the generated `resultados.csv` file located in the configured OUTPUT folder.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Improved heuristic detection of complex disposal patterns.
